    <p>
      I am originally from Mississippi. I recently moved from Atlanta, GA, where
      I had been working as a paralegal. The law firm I worked for specialized
      in Plaintiff's work. It was my first job after college. My plan was always
      to attend law school after gaining experience in the legal field. Needless
      to say, I lost that desire. I attended undergraduate at the University of
      Mississippi (Ole Miss) and graduated in 2016. I decided to relocate to
      Houston, TX, to complete this program and hope to build my network in the
      State of Texas upon completing this full stack web devlopment program.

      As far as life outside of my career goals, I enjoy trying new restaurants
      and breweries, traveling, and watching college and professional sports. I
      am also into fashion. My favorite football college team is Ole Miss. For
      professional sports, I enjoy watching the Green Bay Packers and Phoenix
      Suns play.
